<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, This is kumar vedang, a 3rd year engineering undergraduate student of IIT(ISM) Dhanbad pursuing Bachelor
  of technology in Electrical Engineering.
</p>

<p>Pretty much interested in core electronics. Build a line follower robot using infrared sensors and 
  L298N motor driver, used arduino as IDE. Also worked under professor supervision and assembled a 
  hexacopter with calibration of pixhawk flight controller done using Mission Planner ide.

<p>Machine Learning is also a very interesting subject which i am learning. Not deployed any models yet 
  but figuring out how to do things correctly. Data analysis is the key thing, which i am starving to learn.
  Not proficient in SQL, but will become one.
